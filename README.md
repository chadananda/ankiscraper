# Ankiscraper

One-off tools for massaging output from Anki decks (output with a JSON exporter) into a format I want to use for my flashcard tool.

## to use

* clone repository
* ```npm install -g``` to add ankiscrape command globally
* export anki deck into a folder.
* rename .json file to anki.json and place it in the same folder
* cd into the folder and type ```ankiscrape```
* a new output folder will be created alongside the original with a correctly formatted deck
